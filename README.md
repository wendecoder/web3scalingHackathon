**WE LAUNCH**

#### WHAT IS WE LAUNCH?

**WELAUNCH** is platform that empowers users to pool their resources together in vaults, fostering a collaborative investment environment. Here's what you need to know about vault pooling and participation:

**1. Predefined Vaults:** We offer three predefined vaults corresponding to our higher tiers: Silver, Gold, and Diamond. Each vault is strategically curated to provide users with tailored investment opportunities, particularly focused on IDO events.

**2. Tier-Based Access:** Users can choose to deposit their funds into the vault that corresponds to their desired tier level: Silver, Gold, or Diamond. Each tier offers varying levels of benefits and opportunities for participating in exclusive IDO events.

**3. Collective Participation:** Depositing funds into a vault enables users to participate collectively in IDO events. When an IDO event occurs, users within the vault will collectively join the sale, leveraging pooled resources for potentially greater investment power and increased chances of allocation.

## WHAT COMPONENTS DOES WE LAUNCH POSSES?

**1. Carefully designed and impemented smart contracts**

WeLaunch has a launchpad smart contract that handles everything that's related with the IDO sale, like the IDO's max raise plan, IDO's sale start time, IDO's sale end time, number of tiers that the IDO will gonna have(in our case four tiers), max raise per tier and other stuff too. The launchpad smart contract is developed in a very secure and optimized way so that no one can put an attack on it and also minimizes the transaction fees needed to interact to it to the minimum. There are other 3 main Vault or Pool smart contracts that will let users of our platform pool their many together so that they can subscribe to the higher tiers(silver, gold and diamond) and get guarented and also higher allocation amount. Every functionality of the smart contracts are tested and proved that they work perfectly. The instructions for setting up and also how to run the scripts to deploy the smart contracts and interact with them is clearly provided in this [README](https://github.com/wendecoder/web3scalingHackathon/blob/main/smartContacts/README.md)
